First Time:
1. git init
2. create a remote repository on GitHub
3. git remote add origin GitHub-link
4. have some code, then git add and git commit
5. git push origin master

If you want to create a new feature, then use the Feature Branch Workflow:
1. create a feature branch, which is a copy of your git history | git branch branch-name
2. upload feature branch to GitHub | git push origin branch-name
3. git checkout branch-name; work on the feature; and when done...git add, git commit, and git push
4. create a "pull request" on GitHub so that others can view and comment on your code
5. Once approved, then merge feature branch to master branch.
- merge changed feature branch to unchanged master branch --> merge!
- merge changed feature branch to changed master branch --> might lead to merge conflict, which must then be resolved manually
