/*
getStaticProps will get the data at only build time. 
Therefore, if I add new data, then the website page will not show the new data.
To show the new data, I will need to do build again.
CORRECT!



getServerSideProps will get the data before the website page loads. 
Therefore, if I add new data, and I refresh the website page, then the website page will
show the new data. 
CORRECT!
